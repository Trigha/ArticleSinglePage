          If you look hard enough on the internet, you'll find some really great
          articles about design. They can teach you things like how to make a
          killer SketchUp model or what different types of materials are best
          for which purpose. But as an honest writer and designer, I know that
          sometimes those articles don't cover all of the aspects of design that
          we should be learning about. That's why I want to discuss something
          that there is a limited amount on â€” cheating in design.

          Cheating in Design: Why and How?
        </h1>
        <h1 className="text-xl font-light mt-2">
          Sometimes we come up with ideas and designs that we're excited about,
          but they don't work, or it seems like there are roadblocks around
          every corner just waiting to pop up no matter what direction we take.
          It's during those times that we need to dig deep and fight back if we
          want to move forward. Maybe we're just stuck at some part of the
          design, such as a section that doesn't look as good as it should or
          something more foundational like the overall shape is off and it's
          just not coming together. This is when cheating comes in handy.
        </h1>
        <h1 className="mt-10 font-bold text-2xl">
          But why, you might ask, would I want to cheat?
        </h1>
        <h1 className="text-xl font-light mt-2">
          Cheating can be a great way to overcome your creativity roadblock by
          taking a shortcut around a problem you might be facing rather than
          trying to figure out how to fix it with traditional means. With that
          being said, you should never cheat just because you can.
        </h1>
        <h1 className="text-xl font-light mt-10">
          Cheating should be used as a last resort and only as a way to help
          overcome roadblocks in your design to move forward. You can't trust
          yourself or your work enough to know if something is going to work, so
          instead, there has to be a clear purpose for cheating.
        </h1>
        <h1 className="mt-10 font-bold text-2xl">Why would I want to cheat?</h1>
        <h1 className="text-xl font-light mt-2">
          The main reason we would want to cheat is for the sake of moving our
          designs forward. By taking shortcuts, we're able to avoid guessing and
          guessing and guessing again like we might encounter when designing
          without cheating. To take advantage of our creative minds and force
          them into action, we need an idea of what we're trying to accomplish.
          If you want to force your creative mind into action, the main idea is
          to push forward so you know what you're trying to achieve. This idea
          can be applied to many different design areas such as design itself,
          music, film, and even writing, so why not design?
        </h1>
        <h1 className="text-xl font-light mt-10">
          Let's say that we're working on a poster that we really like, but it's
          starting to get less of an aesthetic appeal that we want or even more
          generic looking. Let's say art is not our major in school, and we're
          stuck on this one poster for an assignment. But what if we could just
          cheat?
        </h1>
        <h1 className="text-xl font-light mt-10">
          First, try to solve the problem with your creativity. Use your brain
          and apply your analytical side to figure out what you can change to
          improve upon what you have. If it still doesn't work, make a rough
          mockup of the poster and start getting those ideas flowing. Look at it
          from all angles and see if there's anything new or different about the
          poster that will make it better.
        </h1>
        <h1 className="text-xl font-light mt-10">
          If you still can't find some way to improve upon it, I would not
          recommend cheating, as you might end up with something that looks more
          like a piece of garbage than something prime for an assignment or
          hanging on a wall at home. You might get a pass because it's "art,"
          but if you get caught, you'll be in serious trouble.
        </h1>
        <h1 className="text-xl font-light mt-10">
          Let's say you're working on a creative concept for your creative
          concept, which can lead to any number of different ideas. You see the
          idea's potential, and it looks good, but there's one design element
          that doesn't seem to work, and you can't seem to fix it. This is
          another good time to use cheating since you're only using the tools
          available for this task. You can always pull out some Photoshop
          effects or image distortions and start playing around with things that
          may end up looking better anyway. The possibilities are endless once
          you take advantage of the creative mind in this manner.
        </h1>
        <h1 className="text-xl font-light mt-10">
          Another example of how to use this type of cheating is for
          photography. Maybe you're trying to take some pictures of a model, but
          your lighting just isn't looking right. You can always jump into
          Photoshop and start painting over some areas that are too dark or just
          don't look the way that they should. It's not really cheating if it's
          within the program you're working with.
